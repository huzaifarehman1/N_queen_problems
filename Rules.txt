‚úÖ All Rules of the N-Queen Problem
Each queen must obey standard chess queen movement rules:

1. One queen per row
Each row must contain exactly one queen.

You cannot place two queens in the same row.

2. One queen per column
Each column must contain exactly one queen.

You cannot place two queens in the same column.

3. No two queens on the same diagonal
No two queens should share a left diagonal (‚Üô‚Üó) or a right diagonal (‚Üò‚Üñ).

4. No two queens should attack each other
This rule is the result of combining the above three.

That means no two queens can be in the same row, same column, or same diagonal.

üìê Summary of Threat Zones
For a queen placed at position (r, c):

She attacks:

    All cells in the same row r

    All cells in the same column c

    All cells on the main diagonal: cells where (row - column) is the same

    All cells on the anti-diagonal: cells where (row + column) is the same

‚úÖ Valid Configuration Means:
There are N queens placed.

No two queens threaten each other.

All rules above are followed.
